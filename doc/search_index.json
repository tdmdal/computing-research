The node is equipped with 32 cores, 1T memory, and 50T storage. It is an integrated part (login node) of a High-Performance Computing (HPC) system consisting of a cluster of around 100 compute nodes. Researchers can work directly on the Rotman node, but also has the option to scale up their computation by submitting large workloads to the compute nodes on the HPC system. RRN is hosted at Centre for Advanced Computing (CAC). Rotman TD Management Data and Analytics Lab (TDMDAL) provides 1st-tier support to users of the system. RRN is currently under beta test. We invite you to try the system and send us your feedback. 1.2 About this User Guide This User Guide focuses on use cases most relevant to Rotman researchers on the RNN. It complements the CAC Wiki document, which covers the usage of the entire CAC HPC system. We encourage users with high computation needs to further read the CAC Wiki in order to take full advantage of the HPC system. 1.3 User Account RRN is available to all Rotman researchers. To request an account, please email TD Management Data and Analytics Lab at tdmdal@rotman.utoronto.ca. Once your account is created, you will receive an activation email together with login instructions. The process ususally takes less than 1 business day. 1.4 Logging on to RRN You will need an SSH (Secure Shell) client to log on to RRN. For Windows users, we recommend MobaXterm. Mac users can use the SSH client provided by the pre-installed Terminal App. In addition, in order to run applications on the server with graphic user interfaces (GUI), Mac users should also install XQuartz. To log on to RRN, Open a terminal window. Windows users first launch the MobaXterm app, and then click the “Start local terminal” button in the home tab. Mac users simply run the Terminal app. Type the folllowing command. (Replace yourUserName with your user name.) ssh -X yourUserName@rrlogin.cac.queensu.ca The -X option enables graphics forwarding so you can run applications with GUI. 1.5 Transferring Files It’s most convenient to use an SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) client to transfer files between your local computer and RNN. WinSCP is a great free SFTP client for Windows users. Mac users can install FileZilla. Use the following information to configure your SFTP client. File protocol: SFTP Host name: rrlogin.cac.queensu.ca User name: (your username) Password: (your password) Port: 22 If you prefer to use command line tools, scp and rsync are good options. 1.6 Loading Software RNN uses Environment Modules to manage its software. Environment modules treat each software and its associated files as a distinct package to be loaded on demand. It resolves conflicts between multiple versions of a software package and configures the environment necessary for running a package. Below are a few commonly used module command. Description Module Command List all available software packages module avail Display a short description of a package module spider packageName Load a package module load packageName Load a specific version of a package module load packageName/version List currently loaded packages module list Unload a package module unload packageName Unload all packages module purge For example, to load the Anaconda Python 3 package, type the below command. module load anaconda/3.5.3 RNN has a large collection of software tools installed. Section Using Software provides more details on how to setup some commonly used ones. "],

(A shell is an environment to interact with the Linux system and run other programs.) If you are not familiar with Linux command, the two tutorials below can get you started. The Unix Shell by Software Carpentry. Learning the Shell by Willian Shotts. Below we also provide a quick reference to some commonly used Linux commands. todo "]
